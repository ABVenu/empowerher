**Objective**: Use HTML and CSS to create a professional invitation card for the launch of your newly established company. This will involve styling text, images, and layout creatively.

#### **Instructions**:

1. Create an HTML page that represents an **invitation card** for your company’s grand launch.
2. Include the following elements:

   - A **company logo** or representative image at the top of the invitation.
   - A welcoming **heading** (`<h2>`) like “You’re Invited to Our Grand Launch!”
   - A **paragraph** (`<p>`) below, including details such as the date, time, and venue of the launch.
   - Optionally, include a brief description of the company’s vision or mission.

3. Style the invitation using the following **styling techniques**:

   - Use **internal CSS** to set the background color of the invitation card (e.g., light grey or beige).
   - Apply **padding** and **margins** to ensure the content is spaced well.
   - Use a **border** around the entire invitation, with a **3px solid blue border**.
   - For headings and paragraphs, use **custom fonts** and **text colors** to enhance the look.

4. Add another **image** within the card related to the event (e.g., product image or company symbol), and style it with a **width of 300px** and center alignment.

5. Lastly, include a **button** at the bottom that says “Join Now!” (non-functional), and style it with a custom background and hover effect using CSS.
