### Part 1: Styling a Nav Bar

Create a simple navigation bar, with the following requirements:

1. **Selectors**:
   - Use at least one universal selector to apply a common font style to all elements.
   - Apply an ID selector to the header and style its background color.
   - Use a class selector to style the navigation links, changing their color and font size.
2. **Pseudo-Classes**:
   - Implement a hover effect on the navigation links to change their color when hovered over.
   - Use a pseudo-class to style the first item in the navigation list differently.
3. **Grouping Selectors**:
   - Group selectors to apply the same margin and padding to both the header and footer.
