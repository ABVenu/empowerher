2. Inside the container:
   - Add an image of the product at the top with a width of 100%.
   - Below the image, add the product name in bold using an `h3` tag.
   - Add a brief product description in a `p` tag.
   - Add a **button** labeled “Buy Now.”
3. Style the container using **margins**, **padding**, and **borders**:
   - Add 30px padding inside the container.
   - Add 10px margin outside the container to separate it from other elements.
   - Set a border with `3px solid grey`.
4. Add **box shadow** and **border-radius** to give the container a smooth, rounded look.
5. Use the `display` property to center the content vertically within the box.
